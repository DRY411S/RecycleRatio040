# RecycleRatios
A suite of Factorio 'trigger' mods that allow you to specify the percentage return of recipe ingredients that can be recovered in my Recycling Machines mod.

In Factorio is not possible to change the contents of recipes whilst the world is running. It's only possible when a new world is being generated, or an existing world is loaded.

Each of the mods in this suite are 'triggers' to allow you to add to a percentage return for the Recycling Machines to use. By using a combination of the mods, you can set any percentage between 10% and 100% in 10% increments. The percentage that you choose is used every time that you start a new world, or load an existing world where the Recycling Machines mod has not been used before.

This is the mod that adds 40% to the total percentage return from Recycling Machines.

# How it works

Simply enable the mod which gives you the percentage recycling return that you want. The next time you generate a new world in factorio, or load a world where the Recycling Machines Mod has not been used before, the percentage return that you've selected will be added to any other 'trigger' mods that you have enabled.
