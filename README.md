# RecycleRatios
A suite of Factorio mods that allow you to specify the percentage return of recipe ingredients that can be recovered in my Recycling Machines mod.

In Factorio is not possible to change the contents of recipes whilst the world is running. It's only possible when a new world is being generated, or an existing world is loaded.

Each of the mods in this suite are 'triggers' to allow you to set a return percentage for the Recycling Machines to use. You can select between 20, 40, 50, 60, 80 and 100% simply by enabling the relevant mod. The percentage that you choose is used every time that you start a new world, or load an existing world where the Recycling Machines mod has not been used before.

# How it works

Simply enable the mod (and disable the other Recycling Return mods) which gives you the percentage recycling return that you want. The next time you generate a new world in factorio, or load a world where the Recycling Machines Mod has not been used before, the percentage return that you've selected will be used.
